Unix tools for manipulating Tableau content &amp; talking to the Tableau Server

Thanks to the large Tableau community and to the documentation and support of Tableau Software, I have created some "unix philosophy" tools to help managing tableau content and manipulating Tableau XML content.

I feel the obligation to share this with the community that has inspired me to write those tools, and to invite developers to contribute to the code.

I will be updating this repository as soon as I cleanup my dusty code.
